<span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. Patients have skeletal muscle and respiratory <span class='symptom'>weakness</span> with or without <span class='symptom'>cardiomyopathy</span>. The objective of our review was to systematically evaluate the quality of evidence from the literature to formulate evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>. The literature review was conducted using published literature, clinical trials, cohort studies and systematic reviews. Cardinal treatment decisions produced seven management guidelines and were assigned a GRADE classification based on the quality of evidence in the published literature. In addition, six recommendations were made based on best clinical practices but with insufficient data to form a guideline. Studying outcomes in rare diseases is challenging due to the small number of patients, but this is in particular the reason why we believe that informed treatment decisions need to consider the quality of the evidence.

<span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> is a fatal genetic muscle disorder caused by a deficiency of acid α-glucosidase (<span class='gene'>GAA</span>), a glycogen-degrading lysosomal enzyme. In this study, the human <span class='gene'>GAA</span> cDNA gene was synthesized from human placenta cells and cloned into a plant expression vector under the control of the rice α-amylase 3D (RAmy3D) promoter. The plant expression vector was introduced into rice calli (Oryza sativa L. cv. Dongjin) mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Genomic DNA PCR and Northern blot analysis were used to determine the integration and mRNA expression of the hGAA gene in the putative transgenic rice cells. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis showed that the glycosylated precursor recombinant hGAA had a molecular mass of 110kDa due to the presence of seven N-glycosylation sites. The accumulation of hGAA protein in the culture medium was approximately 37mg/L after 11 days of culturing in a sugar depletion medium. The His tagged-hGAA protein was purified using an Ni-NTA column and confirmed as the precursor form of hGAA without the signal peptide encoded by the cDNA on the N-terminal amino acid sequence. The acid alpha-glucosidase activity of hGAA produced in transgenic rice cells gave results similar to those of the enzyme produced by CHO cells.

Previous reports suggest that although a diagnostic muscle biopsy can confirm the presence of <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>, the absence of a definitive biopsy result does not rule out the diagnosis.In this study, we reviewed patients with a limb-girdle syndrome who demonstrated nonspecific abnormalities of muscle, without evidence of the classical changes of acid maltase deficiency. These patients were rescreened for <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> using dried blood spot (DBS) testing.Twenty-seven patients provided blood samples for the DBS test. Four patients underwent subsequent genetic testing. Genetic analysis demonstrated that one patient tested positive for <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> and one patient had one copy of a pathogenic variant.In conclusion, the ability of a diagnostic muscle biopsy to definitively rule out the presence of <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> is limited. There is a role for a screening DBS in all patients presenting with a limb-girdle syndrome without a clear diagnosis.

The article provides an overview of advances in the induced pluripotent stem cell field to model cardiomyopathies of inherited inborn errors of metabolism and acquired metabolic syndromes in vitro.Several inborn errors of metabolism have been studied using 'disease in a dish' models, including <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>, <span class='disease'>Danon disease</span>, <span class='disease'>Fabry disease</span>, and <span class='disease'>Barth syndrome</span>. Disease phenotypes of complex metabolic syndromes, such as <span class='symptom'>diabetes mellitus</span> and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 deficiency, have also been observed.Differentiation of patient and disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes has provided the capacity to model deleterious cardiometabolic diseases to understand molecular mechanisms, perform drug screens, and identify novel drug targets.⚫

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human (rh) acid α-glucosidase (<span class='gene'>GAA</span>) has prolonged the survival of patients. However, the paucity of cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) in skeletal muscle, where it is needed to take up rhGAA, correlated with a poor response to ERT by muscle in <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>. Clenbuterol, a selective β2 receptor agonist, enhanced the CI-MPR expression in striated muscle through Igf-1 mediated <span class='symptom'>muscle hypertrophy</span>, which correlated with increased CI-MPR (also the Igf-2 receptor) expression. In this study we have evaluated 4 new drugs in <span class='gene'>GAA</span> knockout (KO) mice in combination with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector encoding human <span class='gene'>GAA</span>, 3 alternative β2 agonists and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Mice were injected with AAV2/9-CBhGAA (1E+11 vector particles) at a dose that was not effective at clearing glycogen storage from the heart. Heart <span class='gene'>GAA</span> activity was significantly increased by either salmeterol (p<0.01) or DHEA (p<0.05), in comparison with untreated mice. Furthermore, glycogen content was reduced in the heart by treatment with DHEA (p<0.001), salmeterol (p<0.05), formoterol (p<0.01), or clenbuterol (p<0.01) in combination with the AAV vector, in comparison with untreated GAA-KO mice. Wirehang testing revealed that salmeterol and the AAV vector significantly increased performance, in comparison with the AAV vector alone (p<0.001). Similarly, salmeterol with the vector increased performance significantly more than any of the other drugs. The most effective individual drugs had no significant effect in absence of vector, in comparison with untreated mice. Thus, salmeterol should be further developed as adjunctive therapy in combination with either ERT or gene therapy for <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>.

Patients with late-onset <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> develop progressive hypercapnic <span class='symptom'>respiratory failure</span> that can be disproportionate to the respiratory muscle compromise and/or thoracic restriction. Although recent studies have reported the presence of a blunted hypercapnic respiratory response in some subjects with neuromuscular disorders and chronic <span class='symptom'>hypercapnia</span>, no study has evaluated the integrity of the respiratory drive in subjects with late-onset <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>. Thus, we endeavor to determine the CO2 rebreathing response in subjects with late-onset <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>.Respiratory muscle strength was assessed by measuring the maximum inspiratory pressure, and the maximum expiratory pressure. The maximum inspiratory pressure reflects the strength of the diaphragm and other inspiratory muscles, whereas the maximum expiratory pressure reflects the strength of the abdominal muscles and other expiratory muscles. We studied the hypercapnic drive response (measured as the ratio of the change in airway-occlusion pressure 0.1 s after the start of inspiration and end-tidal PCO2 in 13 subjects with late-onset <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> and 51 healthy controls.Overall inspiratory muscle strength was within normal limits or slightly diminished in the late-onset <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> group. Five subjects (38.5%) were chronically hypercapnic, and 9 (69.2%) had an increased breath-holding time. Compared with controls, the change in airway-occlusion pressure 0.1 s/change in end-tidal CO2 pressure slope (hypercapnic respiratory drive) was lower in the late-onset <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> group (median 0.050 [interquartile range 0.027-0.118] vs 0.183 [0.153-0.233], P < .001). Nine subjects (69.2%) had a blunted change in airway-occlusion pressure 0.1 s/change in end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure slope.Subjects with late-onset <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> had an impaired hypercapnic respiratory drive response. The clinical <span class='gene'>impact</span> of this phenomenon in this subject subset deserves further investigation.⚫

Diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases in primary care is often challenging. Rare diseases such as <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> are easily overlooked by the general practitioner. We therefore aimed to develop a diagnostic support tool using patient-oriented questions and combined data mining algorithms recognizing answer patterns in individuals with selected neuromuscular diseases. A multicenter prospective study for the proof of concept was conducted thereafter.First, 16 interviews with patients were conducted focusing on their pre-diagnostic observations and experiences. From these interviews, we developed a questionnaire with 46 items. Then, patients with diagnosed neuromuscular diseases as well as patients without such a disease answered the questionnaire to establish a database for data mining. For proof of concept, initially only six diagnoses were chosen (myotonic dystrophy and <span class='symptom'>myotonia</span> (MdMy), <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> (MP), <span class='disease'>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</span> (<span class='disease'>ALS</span>), <span class='symptom'>polyneuropathy</span> (<span class='gene'>PNP</span>), <span class='symptom'>spinal muscular atrophy</span> (<span class='disease'>SMA</span>), other neuromuscular diseases, and no neuromuscular disease (NND). A prospective study was performed to validate the automated malleable system, which included six different classification methods combined in a fusion algorithm proposing a final diagnosis. Finally, new diagnoses were incorporated into the system.In total, questionnaires from 210 individuals were used to train the system. 89.5 % correct diagnoses were achieved during cross-validation. The sensitivity of the system was 93-97 % for individuals with MP, with MdMy and without neuromuscular diseases, but only 69 % in <span class='disease'>SMA</span> and 81 % in <span class='disease'>ALS</span> patients. In the prospective trial, 57/64 (89 %) diagnoses were predicted correctly by the computerized system. All questions, or rather all answers, increased the diagnostic accuracy of the system, with the best results reached by the fusion of different classifier methods. Receiver operating curve (ROC) and p-value analyses confirmed the results.A questionnaire-based diagnostic support tool using data mining methods exhibited good results in predicting selected neuromuscular diseases. Due to the variety of neuromuscular diseases, additional studies are required to measure beneficial effects in the clinical setting.⚫

Late-onset <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> (LOPD) is a metabolic <span class='symptom'>myopathy</span> caused by mutations in <span class='gene'>GAA</span> and characterized by <span class='symptom'>proximal muscle weakness</span> and <span class='symptom'>respiratory insufficiency</span>. There is evidence from clinical studies that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with human recombinant alpha-glucosidase improves motor performance and respiratory function in LOPD.We analyzed quantitative muscle MRI data of lower limbs to evaluate the effects of long-term ERT on muscle parameters.Three symptomatic LOPD patients who received ERT for five years and four untreated presymptomatic LOPD patients were included in the study. T1-weighted MRI images were used to determine volumes of thigh and lower leg muscles. In addition, mean gray values of eight individual thigh muscles were calculated to assess the degree of lipomatous muscle alterations.We detected a decrease in thigh muscle volume of 6.7% (p < 0.001) and an increase in lower leg muscle volume of 8.2% (p = 0.049) after five years of ERT. Analysis of individual thigh muscles revealed a positive correlation between the degree of lipomatous muscle alterations at baseline and the increase of gray values after five years of ERT (R(2) = 0.68, p < 0.001). Muscle imaging in presymptomatic patients showed in one case pronounced lipomatous alteration of the adductor magnus muscle and mild to moderate changes in further thigh muscles.The results demonstrate that fatty muscle degeneration can occur before clinical manifestation of <span class='symptom'>muscle weakness</span> and suggest that mildly affected muscles may respond better to ERT treatment than severely involved muscles. If these findings can be validated by further studies, it should be discussed if muscle alterations detected by muscle MRI may be an objective sign of disease manifestation justifying an early start of ERT in clinically asymptomatic patients in order to improve the long-term outcome.⚫

Respiratory and/or lingual dysfunction are among the first motor symptoms in <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>, a disorder resulting from absence or dysfunction of the lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase (<span class='gene'>GAA</span>). Here, we histologically evaluated the medulla, cervical and thoracic spinal cords in 6 weeks old asymptomatic Pompe (Gaa(-/-)) mice to determine if neuropathology in respiratory motor regions has an early onset. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining indicated glycogen accumulation was exclusively occurring in Gaa(-/-) hypoglossal, mid-cervical and upper thoracic motoneurons. Markers of DNA damage (Tunel) and ongoing apoptosis (Cleaved Caspase 3) did not co-localize with PAS staining, but were prominent in a medullary region which included the nucleus tractus solitarius, and also in the thoracic spinal dorsal horn. We conclude that respiratory-related motoneurons are particularly susceptible to <span class='gene'>GAA</span> deficiency and that neuronal glycogen accumulation and <span class='symptom'>neurodegeneration</span> may occur independently in early stage disease. The data support early therapeutic intervention in <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>.

<span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> (PD) is a rare, inherited autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (<span class='gene'>GAA</span>) enzyme described in 1932 by the Dutch pathologist Joannes Cassianus Pompe. The prevalence of PD ranges from 1:40,000 to 1:300,000 births and depends on geographic and ethnic factors. Clinical manifestations may vary from a rapidly progressive disabling disease with <span class='symptom'>cardiomegaly</span>, <span class='symptom'>hepatomegaly</span>, <span class='symptom'>weakness</span>, <span class='symptom'>generalized hypotonia</span>, and death within the first year of life, to a mild presentation characterized by slowly progressive <span class='symptom'>myopathy</span> predominantly involving the skeletal muscles. The laboratory diagnostic gold standard is represented by the determination of the alpha-glucosidase activity. However, the muscle histology may also yield the diagnosis by evaluating the tissular glycogen accumulation. Until recently, supportive measures constituted the unique available therapy. Currently, the administration of the recombinant <span class='gene'>GAA</span> is being used with promising results. The authors present the case of a 5-month-old boy, previously diagnosed with <span class='symptom'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</span> since the age of 2 months, who presented acute <span class='symptom'>heart failure</span> accompanied by biventricular dilation followed by refractory shock and death.

<span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> is an inherited disorder notable for severe, progressive ventilatory compromise. Although ventilatory failure has been attributed to myofiber dysfunction secondary to diaphragmatic glycogen accumulation, neural involvement of the phrenic motor system is also a prominent feature. Direct diaphragm pacing supplements respiratory function in other disorders of the phrenic motor system. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that augmented neuromuscular activity via diaphragm pacing would promote weaning from mechanical ventilation in patients with <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> who are unresponsive to conventional, muscle-directed treatments.Three patients with <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> developed diaphragm paresis that resulted in chronic mechanical ventilation dependence. After preoperative inspiratory muscle strengthening exercises failed to improve function, fine-wire pacing electrodes were laparoscopically implanted into the diaphragm. Diaphragm conditioning was initiated the first postoperative week and consisted of gradual increases in stimulation parameters, lengthening of stimulation sessions, and ventilator weaning. Ventilation and intramuscular electromyographic activity were recorded periodically during conditioning to quantify diaphragm neuromuscular function.During paced breathing without mechanical ventilation, tidal volumes increased, and 2 patients were weaned from daytime ventilator dependence within the first 3 months of pacing, which has been sustained over the long-term. A third patient reduced reliance on daytime ventilation, but weaning was delayed by malacia of the large airways. In all patients, pacing appeared to facilitate spontaneous phrenic motor unit activity during independent breathing without ventilator or pacer support.The findings are consistent with the view that diaphragm pacing has potential rehabilitative value to reduce reliance on mechanical ventilation in people with <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>, but further study is needed. Diaphragm pacing represents a paradigm shift in the management of <span class='symptom'>respiratory insufficiency</span> for <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> that warrants further controlled examination.⚫

<span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>, also known as glycogen storage disease type II, is caused by acid maltase deficiency, and can lead to lysosomal glycogen storage. The primal manifestations may be observed in children and adults, and also in infants. In general, the clinical spectrum in infants is more progressive and lethal than that in older patients. This case report describes the case of a newborn who was found to have cardiac hypertrophy, <span class='symptom'>hepatomegaly</span> and elevated serum enzyme levels, which was characterized by an aspartate aminotransferase level of 95 U/l, lactate dehydrogenase level of 778 U/l and creatine kinase level of 1,299 U/l. On the basis of the clinical signs and laboratory results, dried blood spots from the baby were tested to determine the acid α-glucosidase (<span class='gene'>GAA</span>) activity, and the result confirmed that the <span class='gene'>GAA</span> activity was only 0.10 pmol/punch/h (normal reference range, 2.88-89.02 pmol/punch/h) at pH 3.8, which was clearly lower than the normal range, leading to a diagnosis of <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>. <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> is incurable, and before the introduction of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), pain relief was the main treatment. Recognizing this disease earlier and starting ERT in infants prior to the development of clinical symptoms is likely to improve the quality of life of patients.

<span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from deficiency of the acid alpha-glucosidase (<span class='gene'>GAA</span>). The late-onset <span class='disease'>Pompe Disease</span> (LOPD) patients develop muscular and respiratory complications later in life. We describe a retrospective observational cohort study including 22 patients with LOPD. The cohort was assessed at baseline before Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alpha (20mg/kg biweekly) was commenced and subsequently relevant information was collected at 2, 4 and 5years later. The median age of the patients at study entry was 44years (16-64years), with median disease duration of 11.5years (4-31years). At baseline, 10 patients (45%) could walk without support, 12 (55%) could walk with unilateral or bilateral support including 3/12 were wheelchair bound. Mean predicted FVC % was 55.7 (95% CI 45-66) of predicted normal at baseline and showed no significant change after 5years (54.6 (95% CI 43-66)), (all p=0.9815). Mean FVC % supine was 41.8 (95% CI 33.8-49) of predicted normal at baseline and remained significantly unchanged at 5years (48.4 (95% CI 37-59.6)), (all p=0.8680). The overnight non-invasive ventilator dependence increased by 18.2% as compared with baseline and requirement of mobility aids increased during this period by 5.2% as compared with the baseline. Mean walking distance at 6min walk test was 411.5 (95% CI 338-485) at baseline, 266.5 (95% CI 187-346) m at 2years, 238.6 (95% CI 162-315) m at 4years and 286.8 (95% CI 203-370) m at 5years (p=0.1981; ANOVA was completed only for 14 patients). A gradual decline in FVC% predicted was noted only in four cases and a decline in FVC% supine in two other. Only one patient showed a decline in both pulmonary function tests. In all remaining cases (17/22) respiratory function remains stable. In conclusion overall pulmonary function tests and mobility remained stable for 5years in majority of patients on ERT. However, in some patients they continued to decline in spite of ERT resulting in increased number of patients requiring ventilation and increase wheel chair dependence at the end of 5years.⚫

Pompe or Glycogen Storage Disease type II (GSD-II) is a genetic disorder affecting both cardiac and skeletal muscle. Historically, patients with the infantile form usually die within the first year of life due to cardiac and <span class='symptom'>respiratory failure</span>. Recently a promising enzyme replacement therapy has resulted in improved clinical outcomes and a resurgence of elective anesthesia for these patients. Understanding the unique cardiac physiology in patients with GSD-II is essential to providing safe general anesthesia. Additional care in maximizing coronary perfusion pressure and minimizing <span class='symptom'>arrhythmia</span> risk must be given. For these reasons, it is recommended that anesthesia for infantile Pompe patients should specifically avoid propofol or high concentrations of sevoflurane and, instead, use an agent such as ketamine as the cornerstone for induction in order to better support coronary perfusion pressure and to avoid decreasing diastolic blood pressure (<span class='gene'>DBP</span>) with vasodilatory agents. We present the anesthetic technique in a case of infantile type <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>.⚫

Enzyme and gene replacement strategies have developed into viable therapeutic approaches for the treatment of <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> (acid α-glucosidase (<span class='gene'>GAA</span>) deficiency).

Preclinical and clinical experience in addressing humoral responses toward enzyme and gene therapy for <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> have provided greater understanding of the immunological consequences of the provided therapy. B- and T-cell modulation has been shown to be effective in preventing infusion-associated reactions during enzyme replacement therapy in patients and has shown similar success in the context of gene therapy.

Infantile Onset <span class='disease'>Pompe Disease</span> (IOPD) is a rare autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder. It is associated with <span class='symptom'>cardiomegaly</span>, hypotonia, paresis, and death in the first year of life. Since 2006, following the use of Alglucosidase alfa as Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), the patients' survival is improved to a noticeable extent.The purpose of this study is to examine the outcome of IOPD patients in South of Iran and the degree of responsiveness to ERT.All patients who were diagnosed with IOPD on the bases of clinical symptoms, and enzyme assay on dried blood spot, were included in the study; and were followed up regarding cardiac function, locomotor activity, and cognition.Six patients with IOPD were identified. All these six patients suffered from <span class='symptom'>Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</span> (HCM). Four (67%) of them also had <span class='symptom'>generalized hypotonia</span>. Three patients expired during the first weeks due to severe <span class='symptom'>respiratory infection</span>. One of them also got involved with Acute Cardiopulmonary Failure while receiving the fifth dose of ERT; and expired. However, the remaining two patients had a significant improvement after the maximum of 117 weeks of following up both cardiac and locomotor findings. These two patients were the same patients who showed cardiac symptoms from the beginning but did not have <span class='symptom'>generalized hypotonia</span>.Although ERT has a significant effect on enhancing the survival of IOPD patients, it should be associated with meticulous heart-respiratory cares during the first months of treatment and preventing infection especially nosocomial infections.⚫

<span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> is a rare metabolic disorder due to lysosomal alpha-glucosidase (<span class='gene'>GAA</span>) deficiency. It is considered as a multi-systemic disease since, although glycogen accumulation is largely prominent in heart, skeletal and respiratory muscles, other organs can also be affected. As regards the vascular system, few reports have documented cerebrovascular malformations in Pompe patients. The aim of this study was to define the presence and type of intracranial <span class='symptom'>arterial abnormalities</span> in a cohort of late onset <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> (LOPD) patients.We have studied 21 LOPD patients with cerebral CT angiography (CTA), using maximum intensity projection and volume rendering technique for 3D-image reconstruction.We found intracranial <span class='symptom'>arterial abnormalities</span> in 13/21 patients (62 %), of whom: 2/21 patients (9.5 %) showed an unruptured <span class='symptom'>intracranial aneurysm</span> (respectively 2 and 4 mm), 10/21 (47 %) had a vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia (VBD) and 1/21 a basilar artery fenestration. Signs of lacunar <span class='symptom'>encephalopathy</span> (insular, capsular and frontal subcortical lesions) were detected in 13/21 patients (62 %) and this correlated with the presence of <span class='symptom'>respiratory impairment</span> (p = 0.017).These findings differ from what has been previously observed in healthy, aged-matched populations and confirm that cerebral arteries abnormalities, mainly involving the posterior circle, are not so rare in LOPD patients and are often accompanied by a lacunar <span class='symptom'>encephalopathy</span> that might represent a hypoxic-ischemic origin. A CTA or an MRA is recommended, in LOPD patients, for early detection of cerebrovascular malformations as they could lead to life-threatening events such as sub-arachnoid haemorrhage or brainstem compression.⚫

Late-onset <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> (LOPD) is a rare treatable lysosomal storage disorder characterized by progressive lysosomal glycogen accumulation and <span class='symptom'>muscle weakness</span>, with often a limb-girdle pattern. Despite published guidelines, testing for LOPD is often overlooked or delayed in adults, owing to its low frequency compared to other muscle disorders with similar muscle patterns. Next-generation sequencing has the capability to test concurrently for several muscle disorders. This could potentially lead to increased diagnosis of LOPD, disorders with non-specific <span class='symptom'>muscle weakness</span> or atypical patients.We developed a gene panel to further study its clinical utility in a cohort of patients with suspected muscle disorders. We designed a gene panel to analyze the coding sequences and splice site junctions of <span class='gene'>GAA</span> causing LOPD, along with 77 other genes causing muscle disorders with overlapping phenotypes.At a median coverage of ~200X (sequences per base), all <span class='gene'>GAA</span> exons were successfully covered with >20X and only 0.3 % of exons across all genes were <20X. The panel showed an excellent sensitivity (100 %) and specificity (98 %) across all selected genes, using known variations in Pompe patients and controls. We determined its clinical utility by analyzing 34 patients with suspected muscle disorders of undetermined etiology and various muscle patterns, who were referred or followed in neuromuscular and genetics clinics. A putative diagnosis was found in up to 32 % of patients. The gene panel was instrumental in reaching a diagnosis in atypical patients, including one LOPD case. Acid alpha-glucosidase activity was used to confirm the molecular results in all patients.This work highlights the high clinical utility of gene panels in patients with suspected muscle disorders and its potential to facilitate the diagnosis of patients showing non-specific <span class='symptom'>muscle weakness</span> or atypical phenotypes. We propose that gene panels should be used as a first-tier test in patients with suspected muscle disorders of undetermined etiology, which could further increase overall diagnosis of muscle conditions, and potentially reduce diagnostic delay. Further studies are necessary to determine the <span class='gene'>impact</span> of first-tier gene panels on diagnostic delay and on treatment outcome for LOPD.⚫

We report a patient in whom the diagnosis of a treatable disease was delayed for 30 years.Recent discoveries of next generation sequencing (NGS) have allowed us to reconsider the diagnosis of limb girdle <span class='symptom'>muscular dystrophy</span> (LGMD) cases of unknown etiology.A 36-year old man appeared to have LGMD with onset in shoulder girdle muscles, but all sarcolemmal and cytoskeletal proteins tested by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry gave normal results.

In patients with Late-Onset <span class='disease'>Pompe Disease</span> (LOPD), progressive respiratory muscle involvement leads to reduced pulmonary function, with <span class='symptom'>respiratory failure</span> the most common cause of mortality. Early disease manifestations include sleep-disordered breathing, which can be treated with non-invasive ventilation; however, progressive diurnal deficits can require invasive ventilation. To determine if pulmonary function tests (PFTs) predict the thresholds for ventilation and wheelchair use, a systematic literature review identified cross-sectional clinical patient data (N = 174) that was classified into ventilation and wheelchair cohorts. PFTs included maximum inspiratory pressure (<span class='gene'>MIP</span>), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), forced vital capacity (FVC), and vital capacity (VC), with vital capacities measured in the upright (-U) and supine (-S) positions. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to calculate cut-points (<span class='gene'>CP</span>) and area under the curve (AUC). For all ventilation and mobility thresholds tested, ROC analyses demonstrated AUC values from 86-89% for <span class='gene'>MIP</span>, 72-96% for MEP, and 74-96% for all vital capacity metrics. Thus, PFTs are useful in predicting the thresholds for nighttime ventilation, daytime ventilation, and wheelchair use, with <span class='gene'>MIP</span> and VC-U having both high AUC values and consistency. The PFT mobility CPs were low (<span class='gene'>MIP</span> CP = 0.9 kPa, MEP, CP = 2.6 kPa, VC-U CP = 19% predicted), suggesting an endurance component associated with wheelchair use.⚫

Elevated plasma cardiac troponin <span class='gene'>T</span> (cTnT) levels in patients with neuromuscular disorders may erroneously lead to the diagnosis of acute <span class='symptom'>myocardial infarction</span> or myocardial injury.In 122 patients with <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>, the relationship between cTnT, cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase (CK), CK-myocardial band levels, and skeletal muscle damage was assessed. ECG and echocardiography were used to evaluate possible cardiac disease. Patients were divided into classic infantile, childhood-onset, and adult-onset patients. cTnT levels were elevated in 82% of patients (median 27 ng/L, normal values <14 ng/L). Cardiac troponin I levels were normal in all patients, whereas CK-myocardial band levels were increased in 59% of patients. cTnT levels correlated with CK levels in all 3 subgroups (P<0.001). None of the abnormal ECGs recorded in 21 patients were indicative of acute <span class='symptom'>myocardial infarction</span>, and there were no differences in cTnT levels between patients with and without (n=90) abnormalities on ECG (median 28 ng/L in both groups). The median left ventricular mass index measured with echocardiography was normal in all the 3 subgroups. cTnT mRNA expression in skeletal muscle was not detectable in controls but was strongly induced in patients with <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>. cTnT protein was identified by mass spectrometry in patient-derived skeletal muscle tissue.Elevated plasma cTnT levels in patients with <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> are associated with skeletal muscle damage, rather than acute myocardial injury. Increased cTnT levels in <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> and likely other neuromuscular disorders should be interpreted with caution to avoid unnecessary cardiac interventions.⚫

Though enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa has significantly improved the prospects for patients with classic infantile <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>, some 50 % of treated infants do not survive ventilator-free beyond the age of 3 years. We investigated whether higher and more frequent dosing of alglucosidase alfa improves outcome.Eight cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM) positive patients were included in the study. All had fully deleterious mutations in both <span class='gene'>GAA</span> alleles. Four received a dose of 20 mg/kg every other week (eow) and four received 40 mg/kg/week. Survival, ventilator-free survival, left-ventricular mass index (LVMI), motor outcome, infusion-associated reactions (IARs), and antibody formation were evaluated.All eight patients were alive at study end, seven of them remained ventilator-free. The patient who became ventilator dependent was treated with 20 mg/kg eow. Three of the four patients receiving 20 mg/kg eow learned to walk; two of them maintained this ability at study end. All four patients receiving 40 mg/kg/week acquired and maintained the ability to walk at study end (ages of 3.3-5.6 years), even though their baseline motor functioning was poorer. There were no apparent differences between the two dose groups with respect to the effect of ERT on LVMI, the number of IARs and antibody formation.Our data may suggest that a dose of 40 mg/kg/week improves outcome of CRIM positive patients over that brought by the currently recommended dose of 20 mg/kg eow. Larger studies are needed to draw definite conclusions.⚫

Quantitation of alpha-glucosidase (α-GD) activity is of significance to diagnosis of many diseases including <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> and type II diabetes. We report here a new method to determine α-GD activity using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) in combination with carbohydrate microarray and affinity surface chemistry. Carbohydrate probes are synthesized for capture of the enzymatic reaction products and the adducts are loaded onto a fluorinated gold surface to generate an array, which is followed by characterization by MALDI-TOF-MS. The ratio of intensities is used to determine the level of activity of several enzymes. In addition, half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of acarbose and epigallocatechin gallate are also determined using this approach, and the results agree well with the reported values. This method is advantageous as compared to conventional colorimetric techniques that typically suffer matrix interference problems from samples. The use of the polyfluorinated surface has effectively suppressed the interference.

Adult Pompe disease/acid maltase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in accumulation of glycogen in skeletal muscles, leading to <span class='symptom'>myopathy</span> frequently involving respiratory muscles. This involvement can cause <span class='symptom'>respiratory insufficiency</span> that may present as acute hypercapnic <span class='symptom'>respiratory failure</span>. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alpha - glucosidase alfa, the only disease-specific treatment, has been available as treatment option since 2006. ERT has shown efficacy concerning muscle strength and pulmonary function in adult patients as well as positive association with survival. We present two cases where addition of ERT to Home Mechanical Ventilation (HMV) showed improvements in lung function and gas exchange that may not be entirely attributable to nocturnal HMV and therefore may further indicate the beneficial role of ERT in conjunction with HMV in Adult <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>.

Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of >50 different types of inherited metabolic disorders that result from defects in the lysosome. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution and demographic characteristics of the different subtypes of LSDs in Eastern China. From 2006 to 2012, 376 out of 1331 clinically suspected patients were diagnosed with 17 different subtypes of LSDs at our hospital. Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) were the most common group of LSDs (50.5%), followed by sphingolipidoses (25.4%) and <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> (19.8%). Mucolipidosis type II/III accounted for the remaining 4% of diagnosed LSDs. MPS II was the most common form of MPS, comprising 47.4% of all MPS cases diagnosed, followed by MPS IVA (26.8%) and MPS I (16.3%). <span class='disease'>Gaucher disease</span> and Niemann-Pick disease type A/B were the two most common forms of sphingolipidoses. There was a large variation in the time between disease onset and eventual diagnosis, from 0.3 years in infantile-onset <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span> to 30 years in <span class='disease'>Fabry disease</span>, highlighting timely and accurate diagnosis of LSDs as the main challenge in China.Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 7 January 2016; doi:10.1038/jhg.2015.155.

Late-onset <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>, for which enzyme replacement therapy is available, induces progressive <span class='symptom'>diaphragmatic weakness</span>. Monitoring diaphragmatic function is therefore crucial but is hindered by the need to insert esophageal and gastric probes. Vital capacity (VC), inspiratory capacity, maximal inspiratory pressure, and sniff nasal pressure are noninvasive measurements but reflect only global inspiratory-muscle function. Diaphragmatic function may be assessable noninvasively based on abdominal contribution to breathing and abdominal volume change during the VC maneuver (AVC-VC), obtained by 3-dimensional chest-wall analysis. In 11 patients, we assessed the relationships between the above-listed noninvasive variables and the invasively measured Gilbert index reflecting the diaphragmatic contribution to breathing (ratio of gastric pressure over transdiaphragmatic pressure swings during spontaneous breathing). Only abdominal contribution to breathing and AVC-VC correlated significantly with the Gilbert index (R = 0.977, P = 0.0001; and R = 0.944, P = 0.001 respectively). AVC-VC correlated significantly with transdiaphragmatic pressure swing during the sniff maneuver (R = 0.743, P = 0.0009) and with phrenic magnetic stimulation (R = 0.610, P = 0.046). Repeat testing 1 year later in the first 6 patients showed concordant changes in abdominal contribution to breathing, Gilbert index, and VC. Abdominal contribution to breathing and AVC-VC are reliable and noninvasive indices of diaphragmatic function in <span class='disease'>Pompe disease</span>, and therefore hold promise as clinical monitoring tools.
